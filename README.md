## 1. What is Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)? ðŸ’‰ ðŸ©¸

According to [Nemours KidsHealth](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/hereditary-spherocytosis.html), Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by spherical-shaped red blood cells (spherocytes) that are more fragile than normal disc-shaped cells. This condition leads to [hemolytic anemia](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/anemia-hemolytic.html) and other health complications. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, with available treatments to manage them.

## 2. What does the MaskRCNN Model Detect? ðŸš€ðŸš€

The Mask R-CNN model, trained on a dataset of digital images of MGG-stained blood smears, can efficiently detect Hereditary Spherocytosis. Traditionally, identifying spherocytes in blood smears is a time-consuming process performed by pathologists. The MaskRCNN model automates this process, offering a quicker and more accessible solution for both patients and physicians.

## 3. Data

* [Dataset A: 186 digital images of MGG-stained blood smears from five patients with hereditary spherocytosis](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c37wnbbd3c/1): This dataset comprises high-resolution images acquired through a microscope with 1,000x magnification (Olympus BX43) and a digital camera (Olympus DP73). The images are in JPG format (RGB, 2,400 x 1,800 pixels).
