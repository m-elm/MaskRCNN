## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Spherocytosis MaskRCNN Detection project. This initiative focuses on utilizing advanced AI techniques to streamline the identification of Hereditary Spherocytosis, providing a faster and more accessible diagnostic solution.

## 2. Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)

Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by fragile, spherical-shaped red blood cells (spherocytes), resulting in hemolytic anemia and associated health complications ([Nemours KidsHealth](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/hereditary-spherocytosis.html)).

## 3. MaskRCNN Model Overview

The Mask R-CNN model employed in this project is trained on a dataset of MGG-stained blood smear images. It efficiently detects Hereditary Spherocytosis, automating a traditionally time-consuming process and providing a more efficient solution for both patients and healthcare professionals.

## 4. Dataset

The dataset (Dataset A) consists of 186 digital images of MGG-stained blood smears from five patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis. These high-resolution images, captured with a microscope (Olympus BX43) at 1,000x magnification and a digital camera (Olympus DP73), are in JPG format (RGB, 2,400 x 1,800 pixels). You can access the dataset [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c37wnbbd3c/1).
